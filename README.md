# Solar Cell Power React App

This project has been converted to a React application with client-side routing using **React Router**. To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application provides three pages:

- `/` – animated "Hello world" landing page
- `/codex` – animated "Hello codex" page
- `/menu` – a simple card grid menu

Build the optimized production version with:

```bash
npm run build
```
